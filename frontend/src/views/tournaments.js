Scrimmage rankings will be used to determine seeds for the Sprint and Seeding Tournaments. For all other tournaments, results from the previous tournament will be used to seed teams (where ties will be broken by the incoming seed in the previous tournament).
</p><p>
Tournaments will be in a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-elimination_tournament'>double elimination</a> format, with the exception of the Sprint Tournament, which is single elimination. The Final Tournament will start with a blank slate (any losses from the Qualifying Tournament are reset).
</p>
<p>
Even if you miss earlier tournaments, you can participate in later tournaments (except the Final Tournament). 
This includes the Qualifying Tournament â€” you can participate even if you miss every other tournament (but your seed will be worse than the seed of everyone who participated in the Seeding Tournament).
</p>
<p>
Each match within a tournament will consist of 3 games on 3 different maps, and the team that wins the most games will advance.

The total prize pool is $30,000. Small prizes will be given out to top teams in the Sprint, Newbie and High School Tournaments, while most of the prize pool will be handed out to top teams in the Final Tournament. We will also probably give out smaller prize sums for various, to-be-determined achievements. Any team that is eligible to participate in a tournament is eligible to win prizes in said tournament.
</p><p>
We will invite all finalist teams to the final tournament at MIT. We will reimburse the cost of travel up to a reasonable cost, with a cap of $2,000 per team, and we will provide accommodation for everyone who is not from the Boston area. All finalists will also be invited to a fancy dinner on 1/31, the day before the Final Tournament.

Anyone is welcome to participate in Battlecode! Anyone can write a bot, create a team and participate in the rankings by scrimmaging other teams. Any team can also participate in the Sprint tournament and compete for prizes. For the rest of the tournaments, however, we can only consider teams of all full-time students. More details follow below.
</p><p>
Teams must consist entirely of active students to be eligible for the Seeding, Qualifying, and Final Tournaments. An active student is a person who is currently enrolled as a full-time student in an eligible undergraduate degree or certificate program. As an exception, we consider those transitioning immediately after high school and formally committed to such a program to be active students, including those taking gap years or in compulsory military service. Active students also include those who are currently in high school. 

</p><p>
Teams of only active MIT students who have never competed in Battlecode (that is, never submitted a bot) are eligible for the Newbie Tournament. Teams of only high school (and earlier) students are eligible for the High School Tournament.

</p><p>
Teams consisting entirely of US students compete in the US Qualifying Tournament. If a team has at least one non-US competitor, it will compete in the International Qualifying Tournament. A US student is a student who attends a school in the United States.
