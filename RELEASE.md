# HOW TO RELEASE

### Preliminaries
- Do what README.md says:
    - Set everything up
    - Install all dependencies
- Install `pandoc` (e.g. using Homebrew)

### Release Procedure
- Make sure everything is up to date:
    - `git pull`
- Choose a version as $major.$minor.$patch (e.g. 1.32.2)
- Run `./release.py $version`.
- Go on Discord and wait for things to catch on fire
