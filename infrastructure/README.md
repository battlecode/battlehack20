# Infrastructure and docker setup

## Configurations in Google Cloud

In GCloud > PubSub:
- Create new topic. Call it `bc20-compile`.
- Create new subscriber. Call it `bc20-compile-sub`. All compile servers will share this subscriber
- Repeat the above, with `bc20-game` and `bc20-game-sub`.
- Ensure retention time for both subscribers is sufficiently high.

In GCloud > IAM > Service accounts:
- Create new service account.
- Add roles: PubSub publisher, PubSub subscriber.
- Download JSON key; call it `worker/app/gcloud-key.json`.

In GCloud > Storage:
- Create new bucket. Call it `bc20-submissions`.
- Grant permissions to the service account: Storage Legacy Bucket Writer, Storage Object Viewer.
- Run `gsutil cors set submissions_bucket_cors.json gs://bc20-submissions` to allow the website to access the files.

In GCloud > Compute Engine > Instance templates:
- Create new instance template.
- Check "Deploy a container image to this VM instance". This enables docker images to be deployed.

## How to use

- For a docker shell to do debugging in, run the following.
  ```
  make worker
  docker run -it bc20-worker
  ```
- For an actual server, run the following,
  where X is one of `compile`, `game`, `scrimmage` or `tournament`:
  ```
  make X
  docker run -d bc20-X
  ```
- To push docker images to the container registry:
  ```
  gcloud auth configure-docker # Only needs to be run once to configure settings
  make push
  ```
- To publish a `helloworld` message to the Pub/Sub, obtain the private key, and then:
  ```
  export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=worker/app/gcloud-key.json
  ./pub.py battlecode18 bc20-compile
  ```

## Tournaments

Here is a brief outline on how to run a tournament.
- Determine seeds in some reasonable way.
  Then, create two files, `team_names` and `team_pk`, containing the names and primary keys of all teams,
  in decreasing order of seed.
- Determine maps to use in each round, and create a JSON specifying this in a file `maps.json`.
  An example of this is in `data/0-example/maps.json`; the round names **must** agree with the round names produced by `bracketlib.py`.
- Check the tournament ID and update the Dockerfile command-line argument to match.
- Deploy a single docker instance from the tournament Dockerfile.
- When the match concludes, a list of replays will be output; feed this into `match_list.py` for human-readable data.
